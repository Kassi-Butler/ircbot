# ircbot
### Project Summary
We aim to create the framework for a bot that could connect to an irc server (namely freenode) and perform various tasks based off user input. Some of these tasks may include:
* Doing calculations
* Store quotes from other users
* Other fun common social media functions (poking/slapping)
* Possibly short simple text game
* A bot affection meter to a user
